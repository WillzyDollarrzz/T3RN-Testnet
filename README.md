  <h2>Smart Contract Deployment</h2>
  
- We'll be using hardhat to deploy 

   - Copy and Paste in your terminal

```bash
mkdir bridge-contracts && cd bridge-contracts && wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WillzyDollarrzz/T3RN-Testnet/refs/heads/main/bridge-contracts.sh && chmod +x bridge-contracts.sh && ./bridge-contracts.sh
```
Now After You've Gotten it, Copy Everthing that was shown from `Deploying Contracts On Each Network...` down to the last word and save.
